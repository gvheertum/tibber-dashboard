# Tibber Dashboard
Dashboard which allows Tibber customers to retrieve power usage, prices and costs from the Tibber environment (clients of Tibber directly get API Access which can be used for this dashboard). If you have a realtime module connected you can also retrieve the actual usage of your house displayed on the dashboard.

## Purpose
- Easy and clean dashboard to get insight in usage and costs 
- Poking around with new technologies
- (Possibly) extending functionality not (yet) available in the app

## Usage
Tool comes with a set of example tokens to play around with. Once you want to start with your own home you provide your API token and you are good to go.
